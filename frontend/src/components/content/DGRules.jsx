            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>    Pick 5 MPO players each Elite Series(+) and Major tournament.  </p>
            <p>    Picks must be submitted by midnight before the first round of the tournament  </p>
            <p><strong>*** IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE PLAYERS YOU SELECT ARE PLAYING IN THE EVENT ***</strong></p>
            <p>    If you select someone who doesn't play, they will be replaced by worst player selected by anyone in the league for that tournament</p>
            <p>    For tournaments with cuts/finals: If a selected player doesn't make the cut, their score will be extrapolated for the rounds they didn't play</p>
            <p>    The above rules apply for a player who DNFs after completing any full rounds</p>
            <p>    A player who DNFs without completing a full round will be assigned the score of a player of their rating for each round (rounded down)</p>
            <p>    The score each player earns is calculated as follows:  </p>
            <p>    <strong>(Player's total score in throws) - (Winner's total score in throws)</strong></p>
            <p>    Thus, lower scores are better.  </p>
            <p>    You can only pick each player 3 times throughout the year.  </p>
            <p>    Add up scores each tournament, lowest score over the year wins </p>
            <p>    Tour Championship Format TBD, probably will be a Finals for only the teams with the lowest scores </p>
            <p>    $25 buy-in, payout sturcture will be determined by the number of players.  </p>
